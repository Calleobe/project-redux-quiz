### The Problem

This week we made a fun quiz game app for learning geography. We used redux and reducers to access the global scope. A few times we were in debug mode and tried to found the cause of some annoying bugs but we managed to get through it. We also added a confetti effect if you win the game.
We didnÂ´t have so much focus on clean design this week, more cosy and fun design for this type of game. Obviously we could have spent more time on design but we have a nice MVP.
